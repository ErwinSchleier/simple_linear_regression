# Simple Linear Regression

## Introduction

This notebook provides a case study for a simple linear regression. With a dataset containing several output records of a solar farm and temperature measurements. We are building a model which is able to predict the daily output with a temperature value as input. This is an excellent case study as it represents a real world problem and includes some data preparation in advance.
